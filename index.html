The app allows students to fill out required forms, upload documents, and apply for concession cards digitally. Each approved concession card contains a unique QR code that can be scanned for verification by transport authorities. Students can scan their own concession card to confirm validity, calculate fare based on travel distance, and track the cost of travel from one location to another. The app also includes a complaint management system where students can file transportation-related issues and view the status of their complaints. This system simplifies the concession process, enhances transparency, and improves user convenience.</h5>
